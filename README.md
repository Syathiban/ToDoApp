# ToDoApp

A little ToDoApp I made. Mainly for learning purposes. 
This app uses a Firebase database to store the tasks and the user data. 
It can have some mistakes, but this is unavoidable if you want to learn something you have to make mistakes. 
This app showed me the world of mobile applications. Swift is a wonderful language, and I hope to learn more about it 
and also try to improve my skills in that language.

# Tip:
You will need to install the Firebase SDK before launching this application.
