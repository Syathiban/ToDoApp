# ToDoApp

A small todo app I made. 
This app uses a Firebase database to store the tasks and the user data. 
It's not perfect, but that's inevitable, when you want to learn something, mistakes are made. 
The main goal is to keep track of your tasks while you are busy working on other things.

# Tip:
You will need to install the Firebase SDK before launching this application.
